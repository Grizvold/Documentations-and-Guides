## BitBucket guide

__Create new branch:__

1. Go to folder of your repository.
2. `git branch <name>` - point to new branch.
3. `git checkout <name_of_branch>` - start using new branch.
4. `git status` - check if you are working on requested branch.
5. `git add` - add changes.
6. `git commit -m "update"`

	__Now if you want to merge and make new master:__
	* `git status`
	* `git checkout master`
	* `git merge <name_of_branch>`
	* `git branch -d <name_of_branch>` - delete branch since its master now and we dont use it anymore.

__Usefull commands:__
`git clone -b <branch_name> <remote_repository_URL>` - clone specific branch.
